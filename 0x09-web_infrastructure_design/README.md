<h1>DNS (Domain Name System)<h1>

<p>DNS is, in simple words, the technology that translates human-adapted, text-based domain names to machine-adapted, numerical-based IP.
For example, somewebsite.com might translate to 136.360.761.24<p>

<h2>The root domain and sub domain - differences<h2>

<p>A root domain is the parent domain to a sub domain, and its name is not, and can not be divided by a dot.

While creating any domain at a website of domain provider, the provider system will always ask you to choose a domain name without a dot in the name. In other words, the address of the root domain may be mydomain.com but it can never be my.domain.com.<p>

<h1>Server and Web Server<h1>

<h2>Server<h2>
<p>A <em>Server</em> is dedicated machine that has the ability to respond to requests made by a client such as, a search engine or a browser.<p>

<h2>Web Server<h2>
<p>A <em>Web Server</em> is responsible for delivering the contents of a website in a package over a secured Hyper Text Transfer Protocol that will be displayed by the browser, or with business logic that needs to be executed by an application server<p>

<h1>HTTP VS HTTPS<h1>

<p>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, the protocol over which data is sent between your browser and the website that you are connected to. The 'S' at the end of HTTPS stands for 'Secure'. It means all communications between your browser and the website are encrypted. HTTPS is often used to protect highly confidential online transactions like online banking and online shopping order forms.

Web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome also display a padlock icon in the address bar to visually indicate that a HTTPS connection is in effect.<p>
