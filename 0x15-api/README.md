<h2>What is an API?</h2>
<p>An Application Programming Interface is a set of routines, protocols and tools used to build software.An API defines how software components communicate with each other and provide the building blocks for building GUI apps.</p>

<h2>What is a REST API</h2>
<p>
    REST is an acronym for Representational State Transfer.A REST API is a way for two computer systems to communicate using the HTTP technologies found in web browsers and servers.
    REST API is a style of API that is used to communicate with internal and external parties in a predictable and consistent manner.
</p>
<p>
    REST a set of recommendations and constraints for RESTful web services. These include:

    Client-Server: SystemA makes an HTTP request to a URL hosted by SystemB, which returns a response.It’s identical to how a browser works. A browser makes a request for a specific URL. The request is routed to a web server which typically returns an HTML page. That page may contain references to images, style sheets, and JavaScript, which incur further requests and responses.
    Stateless: REST is stateless: the client request should contain all the information necessary to respond.In other words, it should be possible to make two or more HTTP requests in any order, and the same responses will be received (… unless the API was designed to return random responses such as the quiz example above).
    Cacheable: A response should be defined as cacheable or not.Caching improves performance because it’s not necessary to regenerate a response for the same URL. Private data specific to a certain user at a certain time would not normally be cached.
    Layered: The requesting client need not know whether it’s communicating with the actual server, a proxy, or any other intermediary.

<h2>What are microservices?</h2>
<p>
    Microservices are a design principle whereby an application is built by dividing application responsibilities into smaller more task focused applications that is independent of all other applications and use an API to communicate.

    Individual applications of a microservice application can easily be scaled and is easier to maintain and deploy.
